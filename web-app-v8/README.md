## Installation of FemtoNET dashboard

You will need to install the `npm` package. I am currently using `npm version 7.17.0` the easiest way to get this is though the `node.js` package.

You can check that you have the `npm` using the following command:

`npm --version`

Once this is successful you can install the dependencies using

`npm install`

and then build the app using `npm`:

`npm run build`

You can run the app in your browser using the following command.

`npm run start`

The application should spawn inyour browser on a seperate node.
